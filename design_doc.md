## Introduction

### Business Problem Statement

HR Luna Park seeks to enhance its recruitment process by automating the initial resume screening phase. The current manual process is time-consuming, inconsistent, and heavily reliant on individual recruiters' expertise. The goal is to develop and implement a machine learning (ML) model that can predict a candidate's likelihood of successful hire for specific roles, thereby streamlining the selection process.

### Current Process Description

- **Manual Screening**: Recruiters manually review each resume, which is time-intensive
- **Subjectivity**: Screening decisions vary between recruiters due to subjective judgment
- **Inconsistency**: Lack of standardized assessment criteria leads to inconsistent candidate evaluations
- **Resource Intensive**: High workload on recruiters reduces time available for strategic tasks
- **Technical Review Bottleneck**: Technical experts must review qualified candidates, creating delays and consuming engineering time

### Business Objectives

1. **Expedite Candidate Selection**: Reduce the time taken to screen resumes by automating the process
2. **Reduce Recruiters' Workload**: Allow recruiters to focus on higher-value activities
3. **Enhance Screening Accuracy**: Improve the consistency and reliability of candidate evaluations
4. **Standardize Resume Assessment**: Establish uniform criteria for evaluating resumes

### Success Criteria

- **Accuracy**: Minimize discrepancies between model predictions and technical expert ratings
- **Efficiency**: Reduce screening time
- **Adoption**: High acceptance and usage rate among recruiters

## Technical Problem Statement

### Machine Learning Task Definition

The project involves two main ML tasks:

1. **Resume-Job Matching**: A similarity scoring system that matches resume content with job requirements
2. **Success Prediction**: A classification model that predicts hiring success probability
    - Primary: Binary Classification whether the candidate will be successful for the future steps or not.
    - Secondary: which final step the candidate will be successful in.

### Quality Metrics and Success Criteria

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Accuracy | â‰¥ 85% | Compare with expert ratings |

## Solution Stages

### 1. Data Collection & ETL
- **Resume Collection**
  - Historical resumes from ATS (2019-2024)
  - PDF and DOCX parsing using Apache Tika
  - Text extraction and standardization
  
- **Data Labeling**
  - Historical hiring decisions
  - Interview feedback mapping
  - Performance review correlation

### 2. Feature Engineering
- **Text Processing**
  ```python
  def process_resume(text):
      # Remove PII
      text = remove_personal_info(text)
      # Extract key sections
      sections = extract_sections(text)
      # Generate embeddings
      embeddings = bert_model.encode(text)
      return create_feature_vector(sections, embeddings)
  ```

### 3. Model Development

## LLM Fine-Tuning

The best-performing model will undergo additional fine-tuning using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This process will:

- Align the model with Luna Park's specific CV and vacancy formats
- Incorporate feedback from technical experts and recruiters
- Optimize model responses based on historical hiring decisions
- Reduce hallucinations and improve accuracy for domain-specific terminology
- Ensure consistent output formatting using predefined XML tags (e.g., <skills>, <experience>, <education>)

The DPO fine-tuning process will utilize:
- Paired comparisons from expert recruiters
- Technical feedback on candidate evaluations
- Historical success/failure cases
- Company-specific role requirements and evaluation criteria
- Training examples with properly structured XML outputs

This fine-tuning approach ensures the model maintains high performance while being specifically tailored to Luna Park's recruitment needs and standards, including consistent and machine-readable output formatting through XML tags.
